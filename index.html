<p>Dear Peter</p>
<p><b>Re:Sales Assistant Vacancy (vancancy number 40568)</b></p>
<p>
    Iam waiting to apply for the position of sales Assistant at ABC Clothing Ltd, which was advertised on <br>
    Trade Me on 14 Feburary 2013.
</p>
<p>
    I have enclosed my CV to support my application. It shows that I would bring important skills to the <br>
    position, including:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <lI>time management and strong organizational skills</lI>
        <li>high-level customer service and friendly relationship management</li>
        <li>cash handling and sales ability</li>
        <li>motivation and dedication</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    As a Sales Assistant at a busy shoe store, I have been able to build up a strong foundation of customer <br>
    service skills. Though I have really enjoyed this role, I am looking for a new challenge in my career. The <br>
    Sales Assistant role with ABC Clothing Ltd would offer me a chance to grow and further develop my retail <br>
    career.
</p>
<p>
    I would enjoy having the opportunity to talk with you more about this position, and how could I use <br>
    my skills to benefit your organization at an interview.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>Lizzie Long</p>
